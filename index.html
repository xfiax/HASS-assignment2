         <h1>assighment 2_Case study of Data Visualization <br></h1>
         <!-------------------------------------------------------------->

         <h2>Example 1</h2> 
         <p>
             The graph below is a data Visualization of what makes peopel happy. Researchers asked 10,000 participants to list ten things that recently made them happy. The result was HappyDB, a collection of 100,000 happy moments. For each moment, the designer parsed out the subject, verb, and object to better see what makes people happy overall.

         By Nathan Yau">

         <p>
            It seems like a very interesting project at first glance.The data visualization successfuly suggests that people's happiness are mostly come from things relate to themselves, as we can see a very big circle in the canvas. Then we notice there are two groups of circles away from each other, and are in different colors. What does it mean? It took me quite a bit time to understand the graph. 
         </p><br>
         <p>
             The difficulty of reading the information from the graph can be analysised through it choice of data and idioms.
         </p><br>
         <h4>data:</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>
                When the author split the data into "subject, verb, and object", there are overlap verbs in the "I" catalog and "others" catalog. Or say there are "common verbs" in this analysis. But this common data is not cataloged individually. So later when the three catalogs are linked together, the linking relationship is wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the "object" part of data, it's the same problem. The designer trys to catagory the diference by "I" and "others". But there are overlabs of objects. Also, does it matters in this case where the object come from?
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Idiom:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The gragh is colored into two groups in order to make a statement that "I" is is the biggest subject make people happy. It losted the objectiveness when this is decided by the designer, rather than relating the color system to the quantity of the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                The circles of the "others" are randomly layout. It doesn't make any statement rather than they are smaller.
            </li>
            <li>
                The curves linking the circles suppose to show the relativeness of the items, as well as the connectivity. But the curves are too weak in the visual aspect.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Improvement:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Re-organize the data in the "verb" and "object" groups. differeciate the data only base on the size of the data, rather the "I or others".
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose a gradient color system for the datas, rather than two discrete colors. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Circles in the "others" group should be layout in a linear arrangement, togethe with the "I", in relation to their data size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give more weight to the curves linking the circles. To show anothe laye of information: the connectivity of the items.
            </li>
        </ol><br>
        
        <!-------------------------------------------------------------->
        <h2>Example 2</h2> 
        <p>
           This beautiful graph is made by Nathan Yau to visualize a 24-hour snapshot for a day in the life of Americans. Each ring represents an activity with a color. More dots means a greater percentage of people doing the respective activity during a certain time of day. (https://flowingdata.com/2021/08/25/cycle-of-many/)
        </p><br>
        <img src="https://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/time-use-2020-radial-v3-correct-data.png" alt=""><br>
        <p>
            It's a poetic graph that it gives the viewer the sense of fragmented life when we look at the loosely organized dots. The contrasted yellow and dark grey give us a quick understanding of two opposite activities dominents two ends of a day. The yellow indicates vatality. The dark grey indicates heaviness. We also notice there are inner and outter rings in the graph. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
            When I try to fully understand the content, I found difficulties. The reasons can by found in the data and idiom it used.
        </p><br>

        <h4>data:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The designer want the inner ring data to be activities relate to home, and outters relate to work. But if we look the activites closely, there seems have so many detailed activites, but not catagoried enough. ie., can the data already can be sorted by certain logic?
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>idiom:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                It's a good choice that the design use the circle diagram to demostrate 24-hour. But 9pm is on the top rather than 12pm, which is the standard setup of a clock. But is "leisure" more outter than "work"? Why "spiritual activites" are between "work" and "leisure"? The activites need to be better catagorized and located.
            </li>
            <li>
                The designer want the inner ring data to be activities relate to home, and outters relate to work. This setup correlate to the intimaciness of activites. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The most promiment color in the graph is "leisure". Why this should be most noticed? Does leisure plays the most important role in our daily life? If this not the case, then what is the color logic?
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Improvement:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rotate the circle so that 12pm is on the top. The overall circle aligns with the layout of a real clock.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give a color system to the activites according to certain catagory structure, rather than using random discrete colors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-sort the data of activites into certain catagory structure, that help people understand their behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Locate the activites in different layers of the ring accordingly to their degree of "intimacy".
            </li>
        </ol>
